                    he phantom pang of missing someone before you ever meet them is an emotion worthy of its own word.
                    That
                    fated feeling of love and the passage of time is the theme that runs between Carly Rae Jepsen’s
                    smash
                    hit
                    “Call Me Maybe” and the National’s antisocial romance “Slow Show”; it’s also the kind of thing
                    Taylor
                    Swift
                    might write about. One of the loveliest tracks on folklore, the surprise album the singer-songwriter
                    made
                    primarily with the National’s guitarist Aaron Dessner, stands out for a strangely similar reason: a
                    thread
                    connecting two strangers that exists long before either realizes it’s there. “And isn’t it just so
                    pretty to
                    think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me,” she sings on the delightfully
                    plucky
                    “invisible string,” simultaneously recalling famous lines from Jane Eyre and The Sun Also Rises.
                    </br></br>
                    folklore will forever be known as Taylor Swift’s “indie” album, a sweater-weather record released on
                    a
                    whim
                    in the blue heat of this lonely summer, filled with cinematic love songs in search of a film
                    soundtrack.
                    There are those who already dislike folklore on principle, who assume it’s another calculated
                    attempt on
                    Swift’s part to position her career as just so (how dare she); meanwhile, fans will hold it up as
                    tangible
                    proof that their leader can do just about anything (also a stretch). While it’s true that folklore
                    pushes
                    the limits of Swift’s sound in a particular, perhaps unexpected direction, her reference points feel
                    more
                    like mainstream “indie” homage than innovation, taking cues from her collaborators’ work and bits of
                    nostalgia.
                    </br></br>
                    At its best, folklore asserts something that has been true from the start of Swift’s career: Her
                    biggest
                    strength is her storytelling, her well-honed songwriting craft meeting the vivid whimsy of her
                    imagination;
                    the music these stories are set to is subject to change, so long as it can be rooted in these
                    traditions.
                    You can tell that this is what drives Swift by the way she molds her songs: cramming specific
                    details
                    into
                    curious cadences, bending the lines to her will. It’s especially apparent on folklore, where the
                    production—mostly by Dessner, with Jack Antonoff’s pop flair occasionally in the mix—is more minimal
                    than
                    she typically goes for. Her words rise above the sparse pianos, moody guitars, and sweeping
                    orchestration,
                    as quotable as ever.
