                        <p class="timeline-text">Earlier, when the ink was thinner,
                            I was ruining my eyes in bad light as a favor to you
                            In a belief that the best opportunities are exacted from the dark</br></br>
                            I was given new maps every day
                            To prevent news of my arrival
                            From reaching any further than the next hill</br></br>
                            I always knew you'd be there
                            Waiting with the door half-open
                            And all the lights on upstairs
                            </br></br>
                            Languishing with some bad news
                            At the end of a few well connected thoughts
                            When a more comprehensive perspective was what was needed
                            </br></br>
                            So I turned and faced the man on the hill
                            Who was sketching the battle from memory
                            Assumption and conviction had come to mean the same thing for both of us
                            </br></br>
                            He thought he should put something down on paper
                            Here near the top of the page
                            Lest you think his work was of some personal interest to anyone

                        <h4 class="timeline-title">Sheltered in Place </h4>
                        <p class="timeline-text">
                            You watch your boy struggle with giving
                            up the turtle, returning it to the pond
                            where he’d found it on a walk—
                            first time you’d all been out in days.
                            </br></br>

                            How thoughtful he thought he’d been,
                            making it a home in the home
                            where the family sheltered in place.
                            How he cared for his armored friend.
                            </br></br>
                            Having picked flowers, knowing they’d die,
                            you understand the urge to pluck
                            the exotic, the beautiful—any diversion
                            from fear, which is in itself a disease.
                            </br></br>
                            That morning, you helped your boy
                            give up the idea of living forever.
                        </p>

                            My father was tall, plump, old and cruel.
                            When he was late returning home, we’d
                            joke that he’d been taken to the morgue.

                            A story teller, he often would say, God
                            Loves good tales with happy endings:
                            The Holy Book’s stories, Layla and Majnun.
                            </br></br>


                            II</br>

                            My grandfather was a bearded man.
                            He looked like the Sistine God
                            His face gleamed with candor.

                            An ayatollah, he believed Allah is afflicted
                            With insomnia no angel can cure—He’s
                            a riddle, a challenge for mankind, God’s

                            grace can be purchased in every bazaar.
                            He’d say, “Don’t pray for me, do it for Him.
                            When He’s jaded, He may stage a deluge.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(img/ba4.JPG)" data-year="four">
                    <div class="swiper-slide-content">

                        <h4 class="timeline-title">On the Day I Die </h4>
                        <p class="timeline-text">The unkempt room, dusty and disused
                            the exiguous perfume concealed in the books
                            the blinking of the alarm clock, jammed printer
                            the cell-phone, the incessant deep sleep
                        </br>
                            the dated OED flashing on the screen
                            the desk, cluttered with stacks of old prints.
                            The black cat lies between my cold feet
                            the long blank night, mute mind.
</br>
                            After the chirp of the cuckoo clock
                            an eerie silence fills the still room.
                            The cat stares at my mute face
                            her paws pressing the fallen ballpoint.
</br>
                            My wife comes in, looks at a piece,
                            the last line, the scribbled words and searches
                            in vain for a clue; she walks over a dossier
                            of unfinished work, a chapbook.
</br>
                            The clotted arteries bring no life to the brain.
                            Thoughtless and cold, it is held taut in a bony
                            box; totally vanished are the stored images
                            past memories, phrases and metaphors.
</br>
                            On the day I die my incomplete works
                            are my orphans; forlorn, they are lifeless,
                            never to be redacted or groomed, lacking
                            the author, they are squashed into the files.
</br>
                            The cat circles the room, rubs my cold feet,
                            pauses, stares at the chair, at drooping hands
                            wants some nibbles, waits to hear my response,
                            voice, mesmerized by my ashen face.</p>
